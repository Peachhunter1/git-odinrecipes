            <li>garlic</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by cutting your garlic and giner. Add to a pan with oil
                on medium heat. Simmer until fragrant but not burned.
            </li>
            <li>Add in your choice of beef and cook to the level of your choice.
                Meanwhile prepare the broth by adding 1 box of pho broth to a pot,
                spice up the broth with soy sauce, sesame oil, salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, while that boils cooks your vermicelli. It should
                only take 2-4 minutes as they cook very quickly. Once cooked, place
                the noodles in a bowl, spoon your broth in, add your beef and whatever
                vegetables you prefer.
            </li>
            <li>Top with cilantro, lime, and sweet chili sauce. Enjoy!</li>
